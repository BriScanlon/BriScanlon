# 👋 Hi, I'm Brian Scanlon

I'm an AI Engineer & Software Developer based in the UK, specializing in building intelligent systems that combine Graph-RAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), document processing, and causal reasoning to solve complex business problems.

I focus on:
- 🔗 **Knowledge Graphs & Document Retrieval**
- ⚙️ **AI-Powered Automation & Insight Engines**
- 🖥️ **Full Stack Development (NodeJS, Express, Next.js, React, MongoDB, Docker)**

I love creating tools that unlock hidden insights from structured and unstructured data—and I'm passionate about building scalable, secure, and efficient systems.
